### HUD

- Health Bar
- Current Zone

### Round Settings
- Set various starting rounds
- Set a delay to navigate to where you need to start the round at game start
- Toggle whether round has insta-kill like behavior or not (useful if you want to practice on rounds lower than 163)
- Set the number of zombies per horde (useful for getting accurate SPH's on maps like COTD or Moon where there are only 23 normal zombies per horde due to a persistent boss holding the 24th slot).

### Box Settings
- Allow the box to roam from a particular location
- Set a specific box location to practice hitting from

### Perks & Drops
- Choose what perks you spawn in with between all, none, or a typical high-round game perk setup
    - If setup set of perks is not to your liking, simply go with 'none' and go buy your own
- Toggle whether powerups spawn or not
- Toggle whether Carpenters, Fire Sales, or Death Machines spawn at an individual level

### Game Settings
- Enable/disable graphic content on the fly
- Enable/disbale Mule Kick on a map
- Turn on/off the power at start
- Open doors on start (this tries to keep some common high-round doors closed, so you can leave this on unless you're testing a certain strategy that requires a more unique door setup)
- Destroy all barriers on spawn 
- Give weapons needed to perform a high-round game (typically the wonder-weapon, tactical grenade, and other weapons typically used in a high round game).

### Map Options
- Set specific windows on Five
- Force activate a specific excavator
- Disable Astro
- Disable George Romero
- Disable nova crawlers on Kino, Moon & Five
